### Evaluation Criteria

**Mobile:** App is uniquely mobile as it highly convenient for users to use their phones to play against their friends and family on the go.

**Story**: Very fun to go up against family and friends and aim for the top spot amongst all app users. I feel it ignites the competitive spirit.

**Market:** Applies mostly to people that enjoy trivia and quiz games, but is accessible to anyone who wants to play.

**Habit:** Highly addictive especially if played against competitive family members.

**Scope:** App isnâ€™t too broad or specific. Strip down app is a quiz app without profile and leaderboard. It should be mderately challenging to get this app up and running with all expected features.
